INSTRUCTIONS

Open Terminal (or Command Prompt) and navigate to the top-level folder:
	‘cd angular2-calendar-master’

Enter the following commands in Terminal

    `npm install`
    
    `npm start`

The application takes a few seconds to load because it was generated using Angular-CLI for demoing purposes. This performance is un-related to the calendar code.

If any errors occur:
1. Ensure that NodeJS is installed on your machine
2. Ensure that you're running the commands from the folder that includes the 'package.json' file.

SOURCE FILES

Source code for the calendar can be found in src > app > calendar. There are 4 files files in this folder:

 sd-calendar-input.component.ts

sd-calendar-input.template.html

sd-calendar-input.style.scss

utils.service.ts

*All other files in the repository were generated by Angular CLI (see below)
